# pinn_research
ipynb files were ran with the google cloab integrated tpu. the pinn.py file was ran with a GPU RTX 3050
requirements.txt has the required libraries for the pinn.py file.
the julia code needs to add the Plots package.
The dataset was taken from the github repository :maziarraissi/PINNs/. 
The code structure for the pinn was also taken from the same repository but I added the weighted loss implementation.
